TODO
======

- Use notfication messages when alert is on; when maximum is reached.

- fix error: doesn't find all sensors when newly adding plugin to panel - sensors library problem?

- read acpi fan state?

- switch to sysfs completely for everythin?

- decrease size of entries in min/max value fields... would have to change renderer for double values...


Known bugs or user requests

- Switching from horizontal to vertical panel does not change layout

- Respect "suppress messages" for error dialogs with acpi/sysfs
